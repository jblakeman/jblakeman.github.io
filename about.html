        <p>My journey as a developer started a couple of years ago when I stumbled into the power of the UNIX command line.  I fell in love with its tools and minimalist philosophy.</p>
        <p>Soon after, I started writing shell scripts, and developed an addiction for solving problems with code.  Through the process I've learned that intense struggle is vital to strengthening my abilities.  This evolution has formed a unique determination when approaching difficult challenges.</p>
        <p>After recently learning many aspects of the web development stack, the next skills I'd like to learn are in dev ops, testing, and deployment.</p>
