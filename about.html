        <p>My journey as a developer started a couple of years ago when I stumbled into the power of the UNIX command line.  I fell in love with its tools and minimalist philosophy.</p>
        <p>Soon after, I started writing shell scripts, and developed an addiction for solving problems with code.  Through the learning process I've realized that without a real struggle it's hard to strengthen your abilities.  This evolution has made me determined when taking on difficult challenges.</p>
        <p>Now, after learning the basics of full stack web development, I plan to learn new skills in dev ops, testing, deployment, and all other areas of the stack.</p>
