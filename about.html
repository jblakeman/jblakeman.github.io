        <h1><a href="about.html">About</a></h1>
        <p>I'm a web developer and command line enthusiast who writes clean, elegant, efficient code.  I haven't been doing this for a while but have a knack for solving problems and fixing the broken things.  I'm always working to improve my knowledge and skills through research, practice, and experimentation.</p>
        <p>Current interests include discovering tasty coffee beans, reading about software development, learning classical guitar, adding to playlists, writing down my thoughts and attending new meetups.</p>
