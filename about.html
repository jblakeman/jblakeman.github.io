        <h1><a href="about.html">About</a></h1>
        <p>I'm a recently discovered UNIX nerd who likes to solve problems.  An epiphany after a struggle and one before a big laugh are two of my favorite things in life.</p>
        <p>I recently graduated from a Full Stack Web Development school.  Aside from strenghtening my knowledge of algorithms and data structures, my interests include learning more about DevOps, containerization, testing, and deployment.</p>
