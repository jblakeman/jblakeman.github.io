        <p>I have like building stuff.  Discovering and developing this passion has given me a more active curiousity, and an increasing desire to share and absorb wisdom.</p>
        <p>Life experience has increased my resolve when breaking down hard problems, recursively renewing a thirst for meaningful challenges.</p>
        <p>Writing, learning about, and collaborting on software continues to reveal itself as an inspiring journey.</p>
