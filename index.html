        <p>I have a passion for building stuff.  Stuff that works, and looks good. Finding and developing this passion has given me a more active curiousity, and an increasing desire to share and absorb wisdom.</p>
        <p>When breaking down and solving hard problems, life experience has strengthened my determination, and increased the passion I have to improve.</p>
        <p>The endless potential that writing, learning about, and collaborting on software allows me to explore continues to reveal itself as a truly inspiring journey.</p>
